# About this data set

This data set includes crime data for the City of Memphis from January - June, 2021. 
Before analyzing this data, I first used 4 excel formulas to extract the time, Hour, day of the week and month.

    Separating the time from the date: =TEXT(B2,"hh:mm")

    Extracting the hour: =HOUR(C2)

    Extracting the day of the week from the date: =TEXT(B2,"dddd")

    Extracting the month from the date: =TEXT(B2,"mmmm")
